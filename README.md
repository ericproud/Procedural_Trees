# About Procedural Trees

This is a small demo showing off the [space colonization algorithm](https://www.jgallant.com/procedurally-generating-trees-with-space-colonization-algorithm-in-xna/) and it's ability to create shockingly realistic tree-like structures. the link embedded above was the inspiration for this project and was very helpful for understanding how the algorithm works.
